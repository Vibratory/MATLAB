Masters thesis project "Signature verification using Support Vector Machine which is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. It works by finding the optimal hyperplane that best separates different classes of data, maximizing the margin between them. This means SVM aims to create a decision boundary that generalizes well to new unseen data."
